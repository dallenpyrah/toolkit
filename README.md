## **Installation**

Detailed installation instructions will be provided once the project reaches the alpha release stage.

## **System Architecture Plan**

- **Frontend Service**: Handles the user interface, dashboard customization, and interaction with backend services via APIs.
- **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for all client requests, forwarding them to appropriate microservices, and handles authentication and rate-limiting.
- **User Management Service**: Manages user accounts, authentication, and authorization.
- **Integration Services**: A set of microservices, one for each supported platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Jira, Trello, Slack), responsible for fetching data from their respective APIs and sending updates to the frontend.
- **AI Service**: Processes data from integration services, generates insights, smart recommendations, and task prioritization.
- **Notification Service**: Sends real-time notifications and updates to the frontend based on data from integration services and the AI service.
- **Plugin Service**: Manages the installation, configuration, and communication of custom plugins with other services.
- **Search Service**: Provides cross-platform search functionality by indexing data from all integration services.
- **Database**: A database for storing user data, dashboard configurations, plugin settings, and any other required data.
